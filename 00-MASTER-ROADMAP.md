# DSA Mastery Roadmap — The Complete Plan

> Based on 20 topic documents (40,224 lines, ~300 problems, ~80 templates)
> Time commitment: 1.5-2 hours/day
> Target: Identify and solve ANY DSA problem with pattern maturity

---

## The Honest Numbers

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Topics | 20 |
| Problems (with full solutions) | ~300 |
| Must-solve problems (core set) | ~150 |
| Templates to memorize | ~80 |
| Estimated calendar time | **20-24 weeks (5-6 months)** |
| Daily commitment | 1.5-2 hours |
| Total hours | ~250-300 hours |

**Why 5-6 months and not 3?** Because retention requires spaced repetition. Solving a problem once is worthless if you can't solve it again 3 weeks later. This plan builds in review cycles — they're not optional, they're what separate "I've seen 300 problems" from "I can solve any problem."

## The 4-Phase Structure

```
Phase 1: Foundation Patterns     (Weeks 1-8)    — Topics 1-6
Phase 2: Core Data Structures    (Weeks 9-14)   — Topics 7-12
Phase 3: Advanced Patterns       (Weeks 15-20)  — Topics 13-20
Phase 4: Integration & Mastery   (Weeks 21-24)  — Review, mocks, weak spots
```

## How Each Day Should Look (1.5-2 hours)

### Day structure when learning a NEW topic:

```
[0:00 - 0:20]  READ the document section (concept, ELI5, templates)
[0:20 - 0:30]  WRITE the template from memory on paper/whiteboard (no peeking)
[0:30 - 1:15]  SOLVE 1-2 problems (easy first, then medium)
               - Set a timer: 15 min easy, 25 min medium, 35 min hard
               - If stuck after timer: read the HINT only, try 5 more minutes
               - If still stuck: read the solution, THEN close it and re-solve from scratch
[1:15 - 1:30]  REVIEW: Write down in your own words:
               - What pattern did this use?
               - What was the key insight?
               - What would I miss if I saw this cold?
[1:30 - 2:00]  REVISE 1 problem from a previous topic (spaced repetition)
```

### Day structure when REVIEWING (every Saturday):

```
[0:00 - 0:30]  Write ALL templates learned this week from memory
[0:30 - 1:30]  Re-solve 3-4 problems from the week WITHOUT looking at notes
[1:30 - 2:00]  Identify weak spots, mark problems for re-attempt next week
```

---

## Phase 4: Integration & Mastery (Weeks 21-24)

This is where pattern RECOGNITION becomes automatic.

### Week 21-22: Mixed Problem Sets (no topic labels)

Solve 3-4 problems per day from a mixed set WITHOUT knowing the topic in advance. This is the real interview simulation.

**Recommended sources:**
- LeetCode Daily Challenge
- NeetCode 150 (problems you haven't done)
- Blind 75 (fill any gaps)

**The rule:** Before coding, spend 2-3 minutes writing:
1. Which pattern does this use?
2. What template applies?
3. What's the expected time complexity?

If you can't identify the pattern in 3 minutes, that's a gap to fill.

### Week 23-24: Mock Interviews & Weak Spot Drilling

- Do 2-3 timed mock interviews per week (45 min, 2 problems)
- Use Pramp, Interviewing.io, or a friend
- After each mock: identify which pattern you struggled with → re-read that topic document → re-solve 3 problems from that topic

---

## Spaced Repetition Schedule

This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Without it, you'll forget 70% in 3 weeks.

```
After solving a problem:
  - Review it 1 day later   (re-solve mentally or on paper)
  - Review it 3 days later   (re-solve on computer)
  - Review it 7 days later   (re-solve cold — if you can't, it goes back to Day 1)
  - Review it 21 days later  (final check — if clean, it's mastered)
```

**Practical implementation:** Keep a spreadsheet or use Anki:

| Problem | First Solved | Day+1 | Day+3 | Day+7 | Day+21 | Mastered? |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| LC 76   | Week 2 Day 5 | OK | OK | Stuck on shrink | Redo | OK after redo |

---

## Roadblocks You WILL Hit (and How to Handle Them)

### Roadblock 1: "I solved it before but can't solve it again"
**Why:** You memorized the solution, not the pattern.
**Fix:** After solving, always write: "What pattern? What was the key insight? How would I recognize this in a different problem?" If you can't answer these, you didn't learn — you copied.

### Roadblock 2: "I know the pattern but can't code it cleanly"
**Why:** Template not in muscle memory yet.
**Fix:** Write the template on paper 3 times on 3 different days. No peeking. If you can't write it from memory, you don't know it.

### Roadblock 3: "DP problems all look different"
**Why:** DP has the most variety. The 4-step framework helps, but experience is required.
**Fix:** For every DP problem, ALWAYS start with brute force recursion. Draw the recursion tree. Identify overlapping subproblems. Add memoization. THEN convert to bottom-up. Never skip steps.

### Roadblock 4: "Graph problems confuse me"
**Why:** Graphs have multiple representations and algorithms. It's hard to know which to use.
**Fix:** Always ask three questions: (1) Directed or undirected? (2) Weighted or unweighted? (3) What am I looking for (shortest path, connectivity, ordering)? The answers map directly to the algorithm. Print the decision table from Topic 14.

### Roadblock 5: "I'm slow — I can't solve mediums in 25 minutes"
**Why:** Normal. Speed comes from pattern recognition, not thinking faster.
**Fix:** Don't time yourself for the first 2 weeks of any topic. Focus on correctness and understanding. Speed will follow. By Phase 4, you should be at 20-25 min for mediums.

### Roadblock 6: "I'm burning out"
**Why:** DSA prep is a grind. 5-6 months is long.
**Fix:** Take 1 full rest day per week (no DSA). If you miss a day, don't try to "catch up" — just continue the next day. Consistency beats intensity. 1.5 hours every day for 5 months beats 8 hours/day for 3 weeks then quitting.

### Roadblock 7: "I can solve problems but freeze in interviews"
**Why:** Interview pressure. No practice explaining your thought process.
**Fix:** Practice talking out loud while solving. Explain to an imaginary interviewer: "I notice this is asking for the longest contiguous substring, and there's a constraint on distinct characters. That's a variable-size sliding window problem. I'll use Template 2 with a frequency map." Do this for EVERY problem starting from Phase 2.
